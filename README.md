Seeing what I can get up to using springboot and maven

Currently figuring out how to move my repo from my bitbucket to github accounts. 

I have discovered that once one starts working on a project (of a reasonable scope, that is) it's actually not too hard to start thinking up different features to implement. Right now the most interesting thing that it does is retrieve a video list from a specific youtube creator. 

After I get the repo moved over I would like to be able to specify a youtube creator to retrieve the video list from.
